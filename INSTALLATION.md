#Installation
To start coding with C#, you may want to compile it first. &#10;&#13;
for that, you need a [compiler](COMPILER.md) (not really surprising, is it?).

If you have the .NET framework installed (most modern windows machines do and most IDEs also install it onto your computer), you can advance to [how to compile your programs and run them](RUNNING.md).

if you don't, you can just download it at [Microsoft's Website](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download) (choose the "Build Apps" Option).
